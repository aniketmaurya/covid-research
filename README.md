Research on Prognosis and Diagnosis of Covid-19


# Introduction
In this pandemic of Covid-19 we have seen a shortage of medical experts all around the globe. There is an urgent need to upgrade the healthcare system with recent technology advancements. We need faster diagnosis and prognosis for patient and hospital bed management. If we can predict in advance that which patient will need intensive care or not then many lives can be saved.

Our motivation for this work is to find how we can use Machine Learning and Deep learning methods to automate the diagnosis and prognosis before time. We evaluate how we can detect diseases with limited amount of data.
